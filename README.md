# Django_ToDo
I wasn't expecting to get to this again But I guess I'm back.

# Overview

This is a simple To-Do application built solely using `Django` and some `Bootstrap` for styling. The application allows users to create, read, update, and delete tasks and also has login functionality.

To install this project, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can clone this repository and run the following commands:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
pip install -r requirements.txt
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver
```

You can then access the application with the local server address provided in the terminal.

For more details, please take a look at the documentation in the repository.
